  <h2>What is coronavirus?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).</p>
  <br>
  <p>These viruses were originally transmitted from animals to people. SARS, for instance, was transmitted from civet cats to humans while MERS moved to humans from a type of camel.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The name coronavirus comes from the Latin word corona, meaning crown or halo. Under an electron microscope, the looks like it is surrounded by a solar corona.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and since named SARS-CoV-2, is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. Little is known about it, although human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As of March 25, more than 18,000 people worldwide have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. More than 420,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19 according to Johns Hopkins Univeristy. </p>
